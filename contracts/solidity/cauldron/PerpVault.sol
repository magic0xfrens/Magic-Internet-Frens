/**
 * @title PerpVault — Community PLV (LP-for-perps)
 * @notice Anyone can supply the liquidity that backs the perp engine's leverage
 *         and earn REAL yield from it — no team ETH required. Two independent
 *         sides:
 *
 *    • ETH side  — stakers deposit ETH that backs LONGS. Yield = a redirected
 *      slice of the perp OPEN FEE + FUNDING + LIQUIDATION PENALTIES, which the
 *      engine leaves in the PLV so the pot (and thus each share) grows over time.
 *      ETH stakers bear the (insurance-buffered) bad-debt tail risk.
 *
 *    • TOKEN side — stakers deposit the current iteration token that backs
 *      SHORTS (the inventory shorts borrow and must return). Because a short's
 *      buy-back always returns the inventory IN FULL, token principal is
 *      STRUCTURALLY PROTECTED — the ETH shortfall of a bad short is borne by the
 *      ETH side + insurance, never the token side.
 *
 *  ── HOW YIELD SHOWS UP ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  There is no separate "harvest": fees accrue INSIDE the engine's PLV, so
 *  `engine.totalEth()` / `engine.totalTokenAssets()` grow and the share price
 *  (assets-per-share) rises. Withdrawing later returns more than you put in.
 *
 *  ── WITHDRAWALS UNDER UTILIZATION ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *  Only the UN-LENT portion is instantly withdrawable (the engine caps lending
 *  at `maxUtilBps`, so a buffer is always free). If your withdrawal exceeds the
 *  free buffer, the remainder is QUEUED as a fixed claim and becomes claimable
 *  (`claimPending`) as open positions close and liquidity returns. Queued claims
 *  stop earning yield and stop bearing bad-debt risk the moment they're queued.
 *
 *  Share math uses a virtual offset (à la ERC-4626) so the first deposit and
 *  donation/inflation attacks are handled safely.

    //  Every name in this block — `ethShares`, `pendingEth`, `assetsEth`,
    //  `withdrawEth`, `claimPendingEth` — predates multi-quote and is now a
    //  LEGACY LABEL for the side of the book denominated in the engine's `quote`.
    //  The mechanics are quote-agnostic and always were: {deposit} branches on
    //  `_engineQuote()` to pull native or ERC20, and every payout leaves through
    //  `PerpEngine._pushQuote`, which pays in whatever `quote` names today.
    //  `depositEth()` is a native-only convenience that correctly reverts on an
    //  ERC20-quoted brew.
    //
    //  THE NAMES ARE KEPT because they are public ABI (frontend, indexer and
    //  tests all read `ethShares`/`pendingEth`), and renaming buys nothing a
    //  comment cannot. But a name that lies has cost this protocol three real
    //  bugs — `ethRecovered` summing 6-decimal USDG into native wei (R-02),
    //  `totalETH` at relaunch, and `plv` counting one asset while `quote` named
    //  another (R-08) — so the rule is written down rather than assumed:
    //
    //      ONE ASSET AT A TIME. This side holds exactly one denomination, the
    //      engine's current `quote`. {PerpEngine.syncGeneration} refuses to adopt
    //      a new quote while {hasQuoteStake} is true, so the asset cannot change
    //      underneath a staker: the vault must be drained first, and a queue left
    //      against zero backing is written down to zero by {_haircut} before then.
    //
    //  ── THE INVARIANT WAS NOT ENFORCEABLE AS WRITTEN (red-team H-2) ───────
    //  It used to cite `plv != 0` as the engine's guard. That is the WEAKEST
    //  possible reading of "drained": `openCount == 0` forces `longOiEth == 0`,
    //  so `totalEth() == plv` and `plv == 0` is EXACTLY the moment a queued exit
    //  has zero backing — the guard passed precisely when this side was at its
    //  most stale. Measured: an 8 ETH queue survived a rotation and took 100% of
    //  a 1000 USDG depositor. And the write-down the second clause relies on
    //  never persisted: {claimPendingEth} zeroed the entry and then reverted on
    //  the very next line, rolling it back. Both halves are now real — the engine
    //  asks {hasQuoteStake}, and the write-down returns instead of reverting.
    //
    //  Anything added here must hold that invariant or convert explicitly.
